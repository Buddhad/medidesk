## Inspiration

Due to increase in covid cases, people are now more restricted to staying in their homes now. This caused problems to people with problems like diabetes who needed lab tests to keep track of their condition.

## What it does

Our plateform allows labs to register with us and link themselves and people can register and book lab tests for them. The labs registered can see the requests on their dashboard and can co-ordinate with the bookings and send their respective attendants for tests at home.

## How we built it

Our tech stack wasNextjs, tailwindcss,flowbite,nodejs,express,typescript,prisma,postgresql flowbite. We hosted the plateform on Azure services given to students by github, made use of several student perks provided by github like Jetbrains IDE to code efficiently, Polypane to help with the design and responsiveness of the website, iconscout premium for the great icons on our website, We also received a lot of help from the plateforms provided to us by github to learn various aspects of web development like Thinkful, fontend masters etc. We used POPSQL to collaborate together to work on the datadabase and run tests collaboratively.

## Challenges we ran into

Database design was a challenging part of the project. Apart from these, many other obstacles were met like connecting the server with the website, designing the UI (tried our best!), implementing our planned workflow was all really tough but successfully achieved.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Since we all are not so experienced in fullstack web apps, creating a working prototype of the planned project was a really proud moment for us. Working together for the whole night livestreaming the code and co-ordinating with friends and successfully publishing the code also gave us a great feel of accomplishment.

## What we learned

We learnt how databases flow works, how we connect and work with fullstack applications and learnt a lot in designing the user interfaces too.

## What's next for MedLabs

We will add more features to our plateform like labs would be able to publish their results on the plateform too and registered people can check their result and co-ordinate with the labs there itself.
